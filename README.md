# MethylChloroform Box models
For the SOAC course Jan Bouke Pronk and Reint Fischer will create Box
Models of the chemical activity of Methyl Chloroform to study the expected behaviour of
ozone-depleting substances.

This repository is used to enhance the reproducibility of the
experiment and to manage version control in the collaboration.
